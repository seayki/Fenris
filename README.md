This app is created for anyone, who wishes to enforce certain rules on their PC, 
whether to increase productivity, or remove bad habits.

Windows App that allows the user to select apps and domains to block.
The user can then create a schedule, which enforces these blocks based on said block schedule.
Domains have the option the be blocked at all times, without having to set up a schedule.

First time setup to retrieve processes and their icons takes some time.
Domains are blocked by setting up a proxy, that intercepts http/s traffic. Does not cause a notable delay on general http/s traffic.
