Windows App that allows the user to select apps and domains to block.
The user can then create a schedule, which enforces these blocks based on said block schedule.
Domains have the option the be blocked at all times, without having to set up a schedule. 

First time setup to retrieve processes and their icons may take some time.
Domains are blocked by setting up a proxy, that intercepts http/s traffic. Does not cause a notable delay on general http/s traffic.
